deep compiler
=============

With the __deep compiler__ Java byte code can be crosscompiled and linked for the PowerPC and ARM architecture. Currently only compile time binding is supported and there are a few limitations:

 - arrays are supported up to three dimensions only
 - "synchronized" is not yet implemented

The deep compiler is written in Java and can be integrated into eclips as a plugin.
